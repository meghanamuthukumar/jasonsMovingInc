# Jason's Moving Inc.

## Problem Statement
Jasonâ€™s Moving Company is now using only a partially automated task. Our aim is to develop a software app that can streamline their operations, improve efficiency and enhance customer experience. The app should enable the company to manage all aspects of their operations, including scheduling, dispatching, tracking, billing, and reporting, in one place. The app should also provide real-time updates on the status of ongoing moves to customers, reducing the number of inquiries the company receives.
